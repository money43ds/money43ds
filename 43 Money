Investopedia gathered and evaluated hundreds of data points from over 50 companies over three months to pinpoint the key factors that matter most to readers when selecting a co-signed or co-borrower loan.

This analysis allowed us to review each company based on fees, repayment terms, income requirements, and additional features. We aim to provide thorough and impartial reviews to help readers make informed decisions that suit their needs. Since its launch in 1999, Investopedia has been guiding readers, and since 2020, weâ€™ve been focused on helping them find the best co-signer or co-borrower loan options.
